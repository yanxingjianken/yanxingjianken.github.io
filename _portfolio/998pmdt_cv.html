Maintaining a reliable electricity supply for metropolitan areas requires substantial effort. Our family business, <a href="https://www.powermdt.com/">PMDT</a>, is exploring trailblazing methods to combine decades of expertise with modern computer vision technology to enhance the diagnosis and prevention of equipment failures from early stages.<br/>
<br/>
My cousins <a href="https://mielan.github.io/">Xiaolan (Angelina) Huang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaolan-angelina-huang/">Feiyan (Jennifer) Ma</a> and I partnered with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/suzhouvitallyai/">Vitally AI</a> to develop a comprehensive model that integrates equipment detection, automated temperature anomaly warnings, equipment failure diagnoses, and solution generation.<br/>
<br/>
With 87% precision in object detection and 100% precision in failure diagnoses, our closed-source algorithm has significantly reduced the manpower needed to monitor crucial substation equipment and issue early warnings. This achievement is due to PMDT's industry-leading database of \(O(10^6)\) records from both natural light and infrared sources.<br/>
