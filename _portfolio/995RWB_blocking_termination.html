Here's the work with Talia on Rossby Wave Breaking orientation changes and Blockings. 
I had an oral presetation at the stormtracks 2025 in Rosendal, Norway, hosted by University of Bergen.

You can find my slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ifp9RpLt7Oq6R_w8L-ioHcMhisT09Alo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116465514317596629476&rtpof=true&sd=true">here</a>。


Atmospheric blockings are synoptic-scale, subseasonal, high-pressure systems that 
stagnate the eastward propagation of mid-latitude jet streams and often drive weather extremes. 
Many blockings are associated with Rossby wave breaking events, identified by potential vorticity (PV) overturnings, 
yet the mechanisms governing the wave-breaking orientations (i.e., cyclonic, anticyclonic, or both) remain unclear. 
Moreover, the breaking orientation can evolve throughout the block lifecycle, often linked to block decay and large-scale weather regime shifts. 
Here we analyze blocking over the Euro-Atlantic region and adopt a PV perspective to decompose 
the time derivative of the low-frequency meridional PV gradient into different terms representing interactions across timescales. 
We separately examine block formation, maintenance, and decay, focusing on the wave-breaking dynamics involved in each stage. 
Understanding the block breaking orientation is crucial not only for improving block prediction and termination, 
but also for better anticipating associated weather extremes. 
A recent example is the wintertime anticyclonically breaking block over the Western United States, 
which contributes to the severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2025_Southern_California_wildfires">California wildfires</a> but also to downstream cutoff lows in the Northeastern United States.
