Tsunami waves transform into a series of solitary waves or undular bores over a mild slope. Nonlinear dispersion of water waves plays an important role in modeling tsunami wave propagation and deformation over varying bottom topography. This paper presents a numerical investigation on the shoaling and runup of multi-solitary waves using the fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations solved with a high-order adaptive timestepping TVD solver (FUNWAVE-TVD).We first simulated 1-D solitary waves traveling up a slope and then validated with solitary wave runup datasets from well-controlled laboratory experiments. Numerical results show that the runup of multi-solitary waves with uniform initial amplitude over a 1:20 slope varies with each individual wave. Then, we extended the simulations of multi-solitary wave evolution and overtaking collisions over a slope for the cases of unequal initial wave amplitude. Throughout our study, we meticulously analyzed and discussed details of wave profiles and runups considering the effects of wave breaking.
