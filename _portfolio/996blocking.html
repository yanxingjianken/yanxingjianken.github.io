Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.leiw.org/">Lei Wang</a> and <a href="https://edwinpgerber.github.io/">Ed Gerber</a>, we examined the utility of Local Wave Activity (LWA) as a predictor of atmospheric blockings.
We defined and experimented with “LWA flux exceedance events”, which are occurrences when the weather system carries more storm activity than the allowance of a pre-determined LWA flux capacity, coming from the "traffic jam theory" proposed by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat0721">Nakamura and Huang</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The work is submitted to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19448007">Geophysical Research Letters</a>; including three key points here:<br/>
<br/>
1. Flow capacity exceedance events, predictors of blocking onset in the traffic jam theory, are defined and evaluated in reanalysis products.<br/>
2. A downstream reduction in flow capacity is ubiquitous for both exceedance and blocking events: lane closures favor traffic jams.<br/>
3. Blocks are co-located with exceedance events in space but not in time, limiting the utility of the traffic jam theory for prediction.<br/>
