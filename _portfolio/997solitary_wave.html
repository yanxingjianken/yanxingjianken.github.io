Tsunami waves causes significant losses to coastal regions, and they transform into a series of solitary waves orundular bores over a mild slope. Yet, the nonlinear dispersion of water waves and wave deformation over varyingbottom topography make the modeling of tsunami wave propagation extremely hard. 
It is therefore important to combine both largescale lab simulations of solitary wavesm and numerical modeling to could capture nonlinearity in tsunami dynamics. 
Withthis work on examination of the fully nonlinear model named FUNWAVE-TVD, which solves Boussinesq equationsto high order accuracy, our research compared numerical simulations with lab experiments on how wave breaksand collides when travelling up a slope, 
which is very close to the real-world situation and tsunami formalization.<br/>
<br/>
We first simulated 1-D solitary waves traveling up a slope and then validated with solitary wave runup datasets fromwell-controlled laboratory experiments. 
Numerical results show that the runup of multi-solitary waves with uniforminitial amplitude over a 1:20 slope varies with each individual wave. Then, we extended the simulations of multi-solitary wave evolution and overtaking collisions over a slope for the cases of unequal initial wave amplitude.<br/>
<br/>
Key questions being asked:<br/>
<br/>
- Wave breaking location of each solitary wave<br/>
<br/>
- Runup height of multi-solitary wave<br/>
<br/>
- Convergent runup height
