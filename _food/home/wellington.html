Under the guidance of <a href="https://www.dealmoon.com/guide/766542">this tutorial</a>, I've made beef wellington for three times and lobster wellington for once.
<br/>
The key difference is that the tenderloin wrapping uses chopped mixed mushrooms cooked with melted butter, but the lobster wrapping uses chopped mushroom and spinach.<br/>
