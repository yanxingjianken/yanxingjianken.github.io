title: "Traffic Bottlenecks: Predicting Atmospheric Blocking with a Diminishing Flow Capacity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-09-13
excerpt: 'Based on NH18 to define LWA flux exceedance events, predictors of blocking onset in the traffic jam theory. A downstream reduction in flow capacity is ubiquitous for both exceedance and blocking events: lane closures favor traffic jams. Blocks are co-located with exceedance events in space but not in time, limiting the utility of the traffic jam theory for prediction.'
