The English-speaking community uses the expression "I'm in town" to indicate their physical presence, but I’ve always found this usage rather unsatisfying. 
"Town" stems from the Anglo-Saxon "ton" (Hampton, Boston, Paddington), later evolving into the American "town" (Georgetown, Charlestown, Jamestown). 
Having spent my first 16 years in Shanghai, the word "town" feels far too small, too ordinary, to capture the vibrant life of the city, 
where the "the" unmistakably refers to Shanghai—never to be confused with New York, London, Hong Kong, or Tokyo.


As the aforementioned quote goes, "The American oranges are wrapped in paper; when they meet the frost-covered jade plums of Beijing, they can't help but pale in comparison!" 
Each city has its own cultured attitude: Beijing turns regal and discerning in the face of the modern era; Paris embodies sophistication and artistry; Zurich exudes precision and understated luxury. 
Shanghai, with all its cosmopolitan flair, still stuns for its “qiang diao” (腔调): a sophistication tinged with a hint of everyday charm, a melody hummed by the city itself.



Should you be lucky enough to indulge in real Shanghai cuisine, you’d be surprised by the absence of caviar, black truffles, or any fancy Michelin star-style dishes. The true charm lies in the simple, the everyday, steeped in strict, uncompromising rules you’d never expect. 
[Xiaolongbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao), a delicate steamed bun filled with crab and pork, will enchant you with its first bite. But for the true locals, only the [golden-claw crabs](https://en.chinaculture.org/focus/focus/2010expo_en/2010-04/22/content_377509.htm) 
from Yangcheng Lake will suffice — and yes, we can tell the difference! Another seemingly humble yet intricate dish is [Yanduxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanduxian), a pork soup enriched with bamboo shoots and tofu. 
But the bamboo must be from the tender tip of the first spring sprout, and, again, we know the difference. 
Equally delightful is [Osmanthus Rice Wine Dumplings](https://www.shanghaidiandimsum.com/product/-glutinous-rice-ball/29), a simple dessert made of fermented glutinous rice, tiny dumplings, and the delicate fragrance of osmanthus flowers. 
Its preparation may seem unassuming, but each element must be perfected, especially the osmanthus, which must be freshly picked to capture the essence of its fleeting bloom. It’s this kind of sophistication, hidden in the everyday, that defines Shanghai.



Some might argue that Shanghai is nothing more than a collection of skyscrapers and fastidious foodies. But in doing so, they miss the true cultural heart of the city: ["Hai pai" (海派)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haipai), 
the fusion of East and West that gave Shanghai its unique character in the early 20th century. Perhaps the closest, though imperfect, comparison would be the Renaissance. 
The Hai pai Shanghai emerged painters like [Chang Dai-chien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_Dai-chien) and [Fengzikai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Zikai), and also evolved the city's own language: [Shanghainese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese). 
Just as Russian would not be the same without Pushkin in Saint Petersburg, or English without Shakespeare in London, Shanghainese would be but a string of code like Python or C++ without [Eileen Chang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Chang) to give it its soul. 
Her work infused Shanghainese with lyrical elegance, blending nostalgic realism with an acute sensitivity to the complexities of human relationships, love, and death, often overshadowed by the relentless march of history.
The language continues to evolve, its art form passed down, from stand-up comedian [Zhou Libo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Libo_(comedian)) to the TV series [Blossoms Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossoms_Shanghai).

Shanghai comes alive at night. It’s one of the safest cities in the world, so walking alone at 2 a.m. poses no concern. In fact, it’s the time when the city truly begins to stir: clubs are just heating up, 
[Haidilao hotpot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidilao) hotpot is at its peak, and locals take to the streets for a midnight stroll, or as we say, "轧马路" (yà mǎ lù). 
You will never regret visiting [Flair](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g308272-d2257238-Reviews-Flair_Rooftop-Shanghai.html) and [Speaklow](https://www.theworlds50best.com/discovery/Establishments/China/Shanghai/Speak-Low.html), both world's finest bars.

But the best part of Shanghai is its people—the true citizens. It’s not about education or economic status, but their attitude, something words can barely capture. Talk to just one or two real Shanghainese, and you’ll begin to understand what I mean.
