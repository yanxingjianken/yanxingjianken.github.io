I am a first-year PhD student in Atmosphere Science at the [EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) department of [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin). My office is at 54-1623A. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) of [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I also received a minor in French Studies from [NYU College of Art and Science](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/french.html) and am a member of [Pi Delta Phi](https://www.pideltaphi.org/).

I have previously matriculated at [Sidwell Friends School](https://www.sidwell.edu), [High School Affiliated to Fudan University](https://www.fdfz.cn/), and [Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy](https://www.wflms.cn/site/site2/index.html). I am originally from [Shanghai, China](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/posts/2024/08/blog-post-1/). 

I am interested in [climate](https://eaps.mit.edu/reseach-concentrations/climate/) and [atmospheric dynamics](https://eaps.mit.edu/academic-programs/atmospheres-oceans-and-climate/) with mathematical approaches. I appreciate methodologies in applied mathematics and (geophysical) fluid dynamics via both numerical PDE and data-driven AI perspectives. I'm particularly interested in predicting extreme events on [the S2S timescale](https://wpo.noaa.gov/s2s/), which is also on the edge between weather and climate. I have investigated in [atmospheric blockings](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/portfolio/996blocking/) and [tsunami waves](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/portfolio/997solitary_wave/), and I'm open to learn more, especially on how such hazardous events evolve under global warming and anthropogenic forcings.

Currently, I'm working on uncovering the relationship among blocking events, Rossby wave breaking events, and different weather regimes. Stay tuned!

### Scientists and academicians: You can view my [CV here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sypjtgcdtnqb#3846ad).

### HR and headhunters: You can view my [One-Page Resume here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/btytsbptfytw#0dfa4c) ([Mandarin Chinese Version](https://www.overleaf.com/read/csdmbvxkngxt#812fd7)).

Post-graduation, I am interested in industrial positions of (but not limited to): Quantitative Research Scientist in Quantitative Finance; Research Scientist in Earth or Climate Science (AI, Energy, or Aerospace sectors); Extreme Weather Event Prediction Scientist in hazard / causality reinsurance and catastrophe bonds; Research / Consulting in Climate Finance and Policy.

### Fun facts: 

My gym hours sit between 11pm to 2am.

I love all kinds of food - from [homemade](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HI1wSVz2_OTsHDeCHw588J2NPk_1lnLLhZz9yXQLzkk/edit?usp=sharing) to [fine dining](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MkS_8FjDAC8YF36vI4oHA-Ww5XbS5BFHpBBz1LpHyWA/edit?usp=sharing).

I competed for NYU Shanghai in a nationwide Hearthstone tournament in China in 2021, and still am an active <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/battlegrounds/">Hearthstone Battleground</a> player.

I'm also a level 10 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZBNk-cTkV4&list=PLu7a4wgbVOVPveGmnrh6HAscW-CiZD5CD&index=4&ab_channel=KenYan">Chinese bamboo flute performer</a>.

I used to compete in high school varsity level <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/dc/washington/sidwell-friends-quakers/athletes/ken-yang/bio/?careerid=2sgg78rlkmpff">American football</a> and <a href="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/1034462/">swimming and diving</a>. I've joined the [EAPS Airballs](https://www.imleagues.com/spa/team/zzz1207783344738140160/home) basketball team in 2024 September.
