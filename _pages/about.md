I am a first-year PhD student in Atmosphere Science at the [EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) department of [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) of [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I have matriculated at [Sidwell Friends School](https://www.sidwell.edu), [High School Affiliated to Fudan University](https://www.fdfz.cn/), and [Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy](https://www.wflms.cn/site/site2/index.html). I am originally from Shanghai, China. 

I am interested in climate and atmospheric dynamics with mathematical approaches. I appreciate methodologies in applied mathematics and (geophysical) fluid dynamics via both numerical PDE and data-driven AI perspectives.

Fun facts: I love all kinds of food - from homemade to fine dining, and I played for NYU Shanghai on a nationwide <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/battlegrounds/">Hearthstone</a> tournament in 2021.

I'm also a level 10 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZBNk-cTkV4&list=PLu7a4wgbVOVPveGmnrh6HAscW-CiZD5CD&index=4&ab_channel=KenYan">Chinese bamboo flute performer</a>, and I used to compete in high school varsity level <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/dc/washington/sidwell-friends-quakers/athletes/ken-yang/bio/?careerid=2sgg78rlkmpff">American football</a> and <a href="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/1034462/">swimming and diving</a>.
