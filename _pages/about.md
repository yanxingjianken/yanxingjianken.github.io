I am a first-year PhD student in Atmosphere Science at the [EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) department of [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) of [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I have matriculated at [Sidwell Friends School](https://www.sidwell.edu), [High School Affiliated to Fudan University](https://www.fdfz.cn/), and [Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy](https://www.wflms.cn/site/site2/index.html). I am originally from Shanghai, China. 

I am interested in climate and atmospheric dynamics with mathematical approaches. I appreciate methodologies in applied mathematics and (geophysical) fluid dynamics via both numerical PDE and data-driven AI perspectives.

======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
