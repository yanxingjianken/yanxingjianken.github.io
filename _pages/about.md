### Bio

I am a second-year PhD student in Atmosphere Science at the [EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) department of [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin). My second generals advisor is [Sai Ravela](https://cse.mit.edu/people/sai-ravela/). My office is at 54-1623A. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) of [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I also received a minor in French Studies from [NYU College of Art and Science](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/french.html) and am a member of [Pi Delta Phi](https://www.pideltaphi.org/).

<!-- I have previously matriculated at [Sidwell Friends School](https://www.sidwell.edu), [High School Affiliated to Fudan University](https://www.fdfz.cn/), and [Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy](https://www.wflms.cn/site/site2/index.html). I am originally from [Shanghai, China](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/posts/2024/08/blog-post-1/). … -->

I am interested in [climate](https://eaps.mit.edu/reseach-concentrations/climate/) and [atmospheric dynamics](https://eaps.mit.edu/academic-programs/atmospheres-oceans-and-climate/) with mathematical approaches. I appreciate methodologies in applied mathematics and (geophysical) fluid dynamics via both numerical PDE and data-driven AI perspectives. I'm particularly interested in predicting extreme events on [the S2S timescale](https://wpo.noaa.gov/s2s/), which is also on the edge between weather and climate. I have investigated in [atmospheric blockings](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/portfolio/996blocking/), [extreme precipitation](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1880140) and [tsunami waves](https://yanxingjianken.github.io/portfolio/997solitary_wave/), and I'm open to learn more, especially on how such hazardous events evolve under global warming and anthropogenic forcings.

Currently, I'm working on 2 projects:

### Atmospheric blocking events - Quasi-stationarity, linkage to Rossby wave breakings, and an extension to the PV tendency framework. 
See my talk at [AMS AOFD 2026, Houston, TX](https://ams.confex.com/ams/106ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/466152)!

### ML Downscaling Methods for Extreme Precipitation in Puerto Rico, and their changes with climate. 
See my talk at [AGU 2025, New Orleans, LA](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1880140)!

### Scientists and academicians: You can view my [CV here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sypjtgcdtnqb#3846ad).

I'm open to future fellowship opportunities. I am generously supported by the Thomas C. Desmond fellowship from Sep. 2025 to May 2026.

### HR and headhunters: You can view my [One-Page Resume here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/btytsbptfytw#0dfa4c) ([Mandarin Chinese Version](https://www.overleaf.com/read/csdmbvxkngxt#812fd7)).

Post-graduation, I am interested in industrial positions of (but not limited to): Quantitative Research in Quantitative Finance (Energy / Commodity Trading); Research Scientist in Earth or Climate Science (AI, Energy, or Aerospace sectors); Extreme Weather Event Prediction Scientist in reinsurance and catastrophe bonds; Research / Consulting in Climate Finance and Policy.

### Fun facts: 

- My gym hours sit between 11pm to 2am.

- I love all kinds of food - from [homemade](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HI1wSVz2_OTsHDeCHw588J2NPk_1lnLLhZz9yXQLzkk/edit?usp=sharing) to [fine dining](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MkS_8FjDAC8YF36vI4oHA-Ww5XbS5BFHpBBz1LpHyWA/edit?usp=sharing).
  
- I am a member of MIT WxChallenge team, which competes in a collegiate [weather forecast tournament](http://www.wxchallenge.com/index.php); we just won a team [championship (2024-25)](http://synoptic.mit.edu/miscellaneous/fc-team/)! My usr_id == eggtrt (2024/25), mndrin (2025/26).

- My research is featured on a BBC radio show! Check it out <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct72wb">here</a> (approx. at 23'30'').

- Thanks to the ai coding agents, I'm building my very own mid-frequency weather derivatives hedging strategies (and bots), with my weather forecasting skills and mathematical finance knowledge (both are very limited tbh!). You can find my backtesting result <a href="https://yanxingjianken.github.io/portfolio/996_mid_freq_trading/)">here</a>.

- I represented NYU Shanghai in a nationwide Hearthstone tournament in China in 2021, and still am an active, top 0.5% ranked <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/battlegrounds/">Hearthstone Battleground</a> player. You can find my US ranking at the <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/community/leaderboards/?region=US&leaderboardId=battlegrounds&seasonId=13&page=353">official learderboard</a> for id = hirondelle (<a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/community/leaderboards/?region=US&leaderboardId=battlegrounds&seasonId=13&page=353">season 8</a>), (<a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/community/leaderboards/?region=US&leaderboardId=battlegrounds&seasonId=14&page=353">season 9</a>), (<a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/community/leaderboards/?region=US&leaderboardId=battlegrounds&seasonId=15&page=127">season 10</a>), (<a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/community/leaderboards?region=US&leaderboardId=battlegrounds&seasonId=16&page=148">season 11</a>).
