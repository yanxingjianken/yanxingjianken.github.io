I've started taking an off-cycle course [12.S592](https://dols.mit.edu/) on machine learning taught by [Sai Ravela](https://essg.mit.edu/), with a focus on (non-Gaussian) dynamical systems. My desired final project is on extratropical cyclone downscaling, using a reduced stochastic model. Here are some PSet notes and schematic solutions, because they are very interesting problems to think about.

Meanwhile, Sai has some preferred naming of the above psets, which I've also included their correspodent Sai-standard names:

- L0 vs L1 Problem: Correspodent Problem
- Subset Selection Problem: Where's Waldo
- Sparse Recovery: All mixed up
- Earthquake Sourcing: Boom!
