I've started taking an off-cycle course on machine learning taught by [Sai Ravela](https://essg.mit.edu/), especially on dynamical systems, with a desired final project of extratropical cyclone downscaling. Here are some PSet notes because these are very interesting problems

### [Particle Tracking in Non-Gaussian Flow (Hungarian Algo (L0 Method), and Sinkhorn Algo (Doubly Stochastic))](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S8aK6yxHOrB6KGC70uqun5TD6wbFwoJ1/view?usp=sharing)

### [Subset Problem: What to do when mapping is expensive? (Resampling and mapping approximation to identify most damaging cyclones from massive input features)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JIthPVkOei6DWFemKd0ZphxuljEVayyW?usp=sharing)
