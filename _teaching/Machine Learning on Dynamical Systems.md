I've started taking an off-cycle course [12.S592](https://dols.mit.edu/) on machine learning taught by [Sai Ravela](https://essg.mit.edu/), with a focus on (non-Gaussian) dynamical systems. My desired final project is on extratropical cyclone downscaling, using a reduced stochastic model. Here are some PSet notes and schematic solutions, because they are very interesting problems to think about. Loading using Google Colab is recommended.

### [Subset Problem: What to do when nonlinear functional mapping is expensive? (Resampling and mapping approximation, to identify most damaging cyclones from massive input features)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JIthPVkOei6DWFemKd0ZphxuljEVayyW?usp=sharing)
